1. Database & Infrastructure Layer
Prisma 7 Setup: Configured the schema.prisma with a User model and established a connection to your PostgreSQL database.

Driver Adapter: Integrated @prisma/adapter-pg to allow Prisma 7 to use the native pg driver for better performance.

Data Seeding: Successfully executed a seed script that populated your database with initial test users (alice_wonder, builder_bob).

Environment Management: Fixed a SASL authentication error by ensuring environment variables are loaded correctly using dotenv.

2. NestJS Core & Shared Layer
Prisma Module: Created a global-ready PrismaModule and PrismaService that manages the database connection.

Dependency Injection: Exported the PrismaService so it can be injected into any other module (like Users, Conversations, etc.) without re-initializing the connection.

3. GraphQL API Layer (Code-First)
Apollo Server Configuration: Set up the GraphQLModule in the AppModule to automatically generate the schema.gql file.

Object Types (Models): Defined the User model with decorators, including a fix for TypeScript strict property initialization using the ! operator.

Input Types: Created a CreateUserInput DTO to handle data sent from the client during mutations.

4. Domain Layer (Users Module)
Resolvers: Implemented the UsersResolver which handles:

Queries: A users query to fetch all users from the database.

Mutations: A createUser mutation to add new users via GraphQL.
